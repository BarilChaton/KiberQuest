First the game does not have any menu screen during gameplay so the only way to exit the game at the moment is to Alt-F4.
Or you can play the game to the last available level.

Keyboard:
Movement - WASD
Jump - Space
Double Jump - 2x Space
Sprint - hold Shift

Controller (as in a PS4 controller)
Movement - Left stick
Jump - X button
Double Jump - X X
Sprint - R1 button.

Currently there are only 3 levels in this version and a crude Main Menu.
There will be more in the final release. :)
Have fun, and give feedback on itch.io :)
